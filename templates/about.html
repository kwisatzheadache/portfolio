                  <h3>Hi there!</h3>
                  <p>
                    I'm a data-centric software developer.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What languages do you speak?</h3>
                  <p>
                    I can talk to computers in Python, c++, Angular,
                    bash, and sometimes Elixir.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How did you get into software?</h3>
                  <p>
                    One day, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a young man named Michael. Although he had grown up in Kansas, Michael had a wanderlust that could not be quenched. He spent many years traveling and exploring, living in eight different states over the course of his adventures.
                    <br>

Despite his love of exploration, Michael was also a deep thinker who was fascinated by the mysteries of the human mind. He decided to pursue a degree in psychology and statistics, hoping to unlock some of the secrets that lay hidden within the human psyche. However, after nearly a decade of working in construction, he found that he needed a new challenge.
                    <br>

Michael began to explore the world of software development, drawn in by its endless possibilities and the sense of creativity and problem-solving it offered. Although he had initially considered studying philosophy, he realized that software development would allow him to combine his love of logic and deep thinking with his passion for building and creating things.
                    <br>

From that day forward, Michael threw himself into the world of software development with all the passion and curiosity that had driven him on his travels. With each passing day, he learned more and more about this exciting and ever-changing field, and he discovered a whole new world of possibilities and opportunities that he had never even imagined before. The rest, as they say, is history.
