Working at Maxar was an incredible experience, filled with exciting projects, cutting-edge technologies, and a culture of dedication and excellence. One of the most exciting projects I worked on was Crows Nest, a tipping and curing base ocean monitoring system that offered monitoring capabilities that no other company had yet been able to achieve. It was amazing to be part of a team that was working on something so groundbreaking and innovative, and I feel proud to have contributed to such a meaningful project.
                <br>
                <br>

One of the things I loved most about working at Maxar was the company's unwavering dedication to its software ideals. "We do it right" is one of the company's core values, and they truly adhered to it in every aspect of their work. This commitment to quality and excellence was evident in everything they did, from the technologies they used to the processes they followed. It was inspiring to be part of a team that was so dedicated to doing things the right way, even when it meant going above and beyond.
                <br>
                <br>

During my time at Maxar, I also had the opportunity to learn and work with cutting-edge technologies like microservice architecture and Infrastructure as Code. As an SRE engineer, these skills were absolutely essential, and they allowed me to level up my abilities and contribute to projects in new and exciting ways. It was amazing to be part of a team that was so committed to staying at the forefront of the industry and constantly pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
                <br>
                <br>

Perhaps most importantly, working at Maxar was a truly enjoyable experience because of the wonderful work culture and passionate coworkers. The people I worked with were some of the most dedicated and talented individuals I have ever had the pleasure of working with, and they made every day a joy. There was a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that permeated everything we did, and it made the work feel not just fulfilling, but fun as well.
